    "One of the most used machine learning algorithms is recommendation systems. A **recommender** (or recommendation) **system** (or engine) is a filtering system which aim is to predict a rating or preference a user would give to an item, eg. a film, a product, a song, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two main types of recommender systems: \n",
    "- Content-based filters\n",
    "- Collaborative filters\n",
    "  \n",

    "\n",
    "### 1) Content-based filters\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations done using content-based recommenders can be seen as a user-specific classification problem. This classifier learns the user's likes and dislikes from the features of the song.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward approach is **keyword matching**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a few words, the idea behind is to extract meaningful keywords present in a song description a user likes, search for the keywords in other song descriptions to estimate similarities among them, and based on that, recommend those songs to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How is this performed?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, because we are working with text and words, **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)** can be used for this matching process.\n",
